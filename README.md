### Hi there 👋, I'm Cherie

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-linkedin-ff69b4)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cherie-liu/)

I'm currently a senior at Columbia studying Computer Science and Operations Research!
I have taken a wide variety of courses at school, like AI, Computer Vision, and Distributed Systems, and I have previously interned at eBay and at Facebook/Meta (x2).

⚡ Fun fact: I crocheted the Harry Styles cardigan last summer!
