### Hi there ğŸ‘‹, I'm Cherie

I'm currently a senior at Columbia studying Computer Science and Operations Research!
I have taken a wide variety of courses at school, like AI, Computer Vision, and Distributed Systems, and I have previously interned at eBay and at Facebook/Meta (x2).

âš¡ Fun fact: I crocheted the Harry Styles cardigan last summer!
